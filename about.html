Hi, I am Faith Annebelle Atieno. Great to have you here. A little about me, I am a junior at the college in Eliot House. I am an international student from Burundi and I concentrate in mechanical engineering under the mechanical systems track. I am taking this class because I like the structure of just being able to do something that resonates with me, which we rarely find in other classes. I work as a CA in math 21a as for Fall2025, but I am also a peer tutor for CS50 and other math classes. Outside classes, I am finding the next song to obsess over, singing, going to social events, pretending to teach my friends how to dance, and also blogging. Last part of blogging: it is a new thing (not really: I usually write for myself), so feel free to read when you are bored, the blogs are so random. Yu can see more of me outside of class on Instagram or Tiktok, and also on Blogpost where I post my blogs.</p>
