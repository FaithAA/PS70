<h2><b>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</b></h2>
<p class="margin">
  Here are 3 ideas that I have brainstormed for my final project.
  Shout out to Nathan for this quote:  
  <em>"If there was a problem you wanted to solve in the world, what would it be?"</em>  
  I'm still in the process of figuring it out.

<h4><b>Idea 1: Self-Adjusting Solar Panel</b></h4>
<p class="margin">
Most solar panels installed on rooftops are fixed in one direction, usually optimized to capture sunlight during a specific part of the day. While this setup is effective when the sunlight hits the panel at a near-perpendicular angle, it becomes less efficient as the day goes on — especially in regions that experience long hours of sun. This is because, as the Earth rotates, the Sun appears to move across the sky, and the angle of sunlight hitting the panel becomes less optimal.

For this project, I’d like to design a sun-tracking system that can detect where sunlight is strongest and rotate the solar panel clockwise throughout the day to maintain a better angle of incidence. The idea is to use light sensors (like photoresistors) to determine the direction of maximum light and trigger a motorized rotation to follow that path.

This system assumes that the panel has free space to rotate, which would be considered in the design. The goal is to increase energy efficiency by ensuring the panel is consistently aligned with the most direct sunlight — using a simple, low-cost setup that could be adapted to small-scale or off-grid applications.

<h4><b>Idea 2: Dancing Robot </b></h4>
<p class = "margin">
As someone who grew up in a place where almost everyone could dance — or at least move with the beat — I’ve always found it funny and kind of confusing that some of my friends just can’t. Like, the beat is there... but they’re somewhere else entirely.

So for this project, I want to build a small robot that, once given a song, listens and moves with it — ideally at the peak frequencies or beats. The robot wouldn’t do full choreo or anything complicated, but just move in a way that follows the rhythm, kind of like a buddy who's vibing with you.

Honestly, I think it would be such a fun thing to gift to some of my friends who want to learn how to dance, but don’t know where to start. They could even mirror the robot and feel how the beat translates to motion. It’s fun, silly, useful — and totally me.
